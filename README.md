Git Goodies
===========

`gg` is forked from [qw3rtman](https://github.com/qw3rtman/gg/) to add proper SSH functionalities for my own use. All other functionalities are the same, please see the original for all manuals etc.

## [Installation](https://github.com/jherrane/gg/blob/master/install.sh)
**Linux/OSX**
```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/jherrane/gg/blob/master/install.sh | bash
```

All this installation script does is download the `gg` script, make it an executable, and copy it to your $PATH (/usr/local/bin). For copying to your $PATH, it may require you to enter your password.
